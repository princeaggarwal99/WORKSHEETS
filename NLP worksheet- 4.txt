NLP – WORKSHEET 4  solutions:

1.) A) It consists of a set of production rules
    B) The production rules are of the following form:
       A-> BC where A is non terminal while B, C can be either terminal or non-terminal 

2.) A) All the production rules in PCFG has probability associated with them while in CFG we do not have
       Probability of a production rule.
    B) With PCFG we can find the most probable parse tree of a sentence which we cannot find CFG.

3.) D) All of the above

4.) A) Free word parsing
 
5.) A) It establish dependencies between words of a sentence
    B) The dependencies are established in terms of subject-object-verb and other dependencies.
    C) We make the parse tree in Top-Down approach

6.) A) Chunking

7.) C) It uses the POS tags of the required word as well as previous word to assign IOB label

8.) B) It assigns IOB entity label to a word based on the POS tag of the word
    C) It assigns that IOB label which has the maximum probability based on the POS tag

9.) C) It uses the POS tag of the word and its previous word to assign the most probable IOB label

10.) A) Unigram chunker 
     B) Bigram chunker

11.) A) Word Tokenization 
     B) Lemmatization
     D) POS tagging

12.) D) All of the above

13.) A) It starts with start symbol S
     B) we use the CFG production rule to generate the sentence from the S start symbol

14.) A) pattern = “#\w*” 
    
15.) D) pattern = “@?”
