MACHINE LEARNING â€“ WORKSHEET 7 solutions:

1.) B) SVMs uses kernel functions to avoid computational load of converting the whole dataset in to higher
       dimensional space where the data is linearly separable.
    C) SVMs can separate classes only when the data is linearly separable.

2.) D) cannot be determined from the curve

3.) A) The RBF is used to find the linear classifier for the data in to infinite dimensional space.
    B) Higher the value of gamma of RBF the more flexible the classifier curve becomes in the original
       dimensions. 

4.) C) Both of them can be used

5.) B) The margin width will Increase

6.) A) Figure A

7.) C) D3>D2>D1

8.) B) Gamma1 > Gamma2

9.) B) The model would consider only the points close to the hyperplane for modelling

10.) A) A large number of misclassification would happen
