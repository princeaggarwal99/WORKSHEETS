1.) A) Yes

2.) A) Red

3.) B) They cannot be used when the data is not completely linearly separable while allowing no errors
    C) They are not optimal to use in case of outliers

4.) D) All of the above

5.) B) No

6.) A) They are less sensitive to outliers and can be used even in their presence
    C) They allow some degree of errors or misclassification


7.) D) All of the above

8.) A) These functions gives value of the dot product of pairs of data-points in the desired higher dimensional
    space without even explicitly converting the whole data in to higher dimensional space
    C) The data product values given by the kernel functions are used to find the classifier in the higher
    dimensional space.

9.) C) It is a model trained using supervised learning. It can be used for classification and regression.

10.) D) All of the above
