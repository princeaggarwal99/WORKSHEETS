11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Answer:-
List:  list is a collection which is ordered , lists are mutable (changeable) ,Brackets used to represent: [],Lists are like arrays declared in other languages.
tuple: Collection of items which is ordered ,Tuples are immutable (unchangeable) ,Brackets used to represent: ()
sets: Collection of Unordered and Unindexed items,Sets are mutable (changeable).,Does not take duplicate Values,Brackets used to represent: { }
Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed,In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
Brackets used to represent: {}

12.Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’
with space in python
Answer:-
yes, strings are mutable in python.
x="I+Love+Python"
x.replace('+',' ')

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.

Answer:-
The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
example:=
input:  x="z"
        ord(x)
output: 122
therefore, ord() returned the unicode of a single character

function for getting the datatype of a variable in python:
def datatype(z):
    a=type(z)
    return a

14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.

Answer:-

import cmath
a=float(input("enter value of a "))
b=float(input("enter value of b "))
c=float(input("enter value of c "))

# discriminant
d=(b**2)-(4*a*c)

x1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
x2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
print(x1,x2)

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‘n’.

Answer:-
def find_sum(n):
    sum=0
    x=1
    while x<=n :
        sum = sum + x
        x = x + 1
    return sum

n=int(input("enter the value for n :"))
print(find_sum(n))
